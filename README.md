# Data-Base-Management-System
This project focused on designing and implementing a complete database-driven dashboard system for a Rideshare service
divided into five phases. It began with identifying the business goals and capturing the necessary data. An Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram was then created featuring at least five entities, multiple relationships—including one involving more than two entities—and various attribute types. The EER was converted into relational schemas, defining primary, foreign, and candidate keys along with functional dependencies. In Phase 4, the database was implemented using Oracle RDBMS on Omega, including DDL scripts to create tables, DML scripts to populate and update data, and ad-hoc SQL queries to validate operations. Finally, a front-end application was developed to interface with the backend database, enabling real-time access and interaction with the Rideshare data.
