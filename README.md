# Rideshare-Service-Database-Dashboard.
The Project is divides into 5 Phases-
**phase 1**
- General Problem Description
- Data to be captured for your business
- Business goals.

**Phase 2**
- The resulting EER diagram
- That contains at least 5 entities, 5 relationships, one of them preferably on more than 2 entities 
– contains some attributes for entities and relationships
– contains some composite/multi-valued/composite multi-valued attributes
– Entities should have keys clearly identified

**Phase 3**

- convert the EER diagram of phase 2 into relations using the mapping steps
- Identify the primary keys and foreign keys in all the relations. Draw the arrows
- Identify other keys (candidate keys) in your relations and list them.
- Identify functional dependencies for each relation in your application and list them


**phase 4**

- finally transformed the relations into tables in a specific Relational database 
management system (RDBMS) by using DDL. We will use Oracle RDBMS on Omega for this 
project.
- contains - Step 1: DDL Script of creating tables
-Step 2: DML Script of inserting about 50 rows in each table
-Step 3: DML Update Script (Create a script that will update the database through a series of insertions, deletes, and updates. 
This will allow you to verify the correctness of your queries when the database is 
updated/changed)
-Step 4: Drop script ( a script that will drop all the tables you have created for your project)
-Step 5: Ad-hoc SQL queries (This script should 
contains 6 queries)


**Phase 5**
-In this phase, we had developed a front-end application on your laptop (or some machine) that 
will interface with your DBMS on Omega at the backend
